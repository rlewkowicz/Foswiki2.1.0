---+ HTTPS -- get HTTPS headers

The same as =%<nop>HTTP%= but operates on the HTTPS environment variables present when the SSL protocol is in effect. Can be used to determine whether SSL is turned on.
   * Called with the name of an HTTP request header field, returns its value. Capitalization and the use of hyphens versus underscores are not significant.
   * Request headers are sent by the browser to the server. It is not possible to access the Response headers returned to the browser.
   * Only returns headers permitted by site configuration.
   * When called without a parameter, nothing is returned. See VarHTTPS for other options.
<div class='foswikiHelp'>%X% The HTTP and HTTPS macros are deprecated as of Foswiki release 2.1. and will be removed in a future release.</div>
