---+!! Configure Plugin
%FORMFIELD{"Description"}%

This plugin provides access to all %WIKITOOLNAME% configuration data through
the webserver, supports running server-side checkers and wizards, and
allows you to save modifications.

You do not have to have this plugin installed to run %WIKITOOLNAME%. Checkers
and wizards can be run from the command-line using the =tools/configure_test=
script, and !LocalSite.cfg can be manually edited to add your required settings.
However this UI provides a simple way to access the configuration without
requiring login access to the server.

If your system has an existing !LocalSite.cfg, then you *must* be
logged in to %WIKITOOLNAME% as an administrator, or as a user identified by the 
={FeatureAccess}{Configure}= parameter before attempting to use
this interface. If no !LocalSite.cfg exists, then you will automatically
logged in as an admin.  Do not log out of Foswiki until you have done one or
more of the following:
   * Registered a user and added them to the %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup
   * Registered a user and added them to the ={FeatureAccess}{Configure}= list of users
   * Set an _internal admin_ user password in the expert setting ={Password}=

Users of the =configure= interface access it through the CGI script in
=bin/configure=. The UI is self-explanatory and needs no further introduction
here.

Of interest to developers may be the JSON RPC interface provided by the
plugin, which gives access to the Foswiki configuration to web clients
(who must, of course, meet the above criteria to make RPC calls).


---++ Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface

RPC calls are handled via the =JsonRpcContrib=. Callers must authenticate
as admins, or the request will be rejected with a 403 status.

Note: If Foswiki is running in 'bootstrap' mode (without a !LocalSite.cfg)
then *all* calls are automatically assumed to be from an admin. As soon
as a !LocalSite.cfg is put in place, then the authentication set up
therein will apply, and users are required to logged in as admins.

Entry points for each of the static methods published by the
Foswiki::Configure::Query class are supported. See that class for
descriptions.


---++ Invocation examples

Call using a URL of the format:

=%SCRIPTURL{"jsonrpc"}%/configure=

while POSTing a request encoded according to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification:

<verbatim>
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0", 
  method: "getspec", 
  params: {
     get : { keys: "{DataDir}" },
     depth : 0
  }, 
  id: "caller's id"
}
</verbatim>

---++ .spec format
The format of .spec files is documented in detail in
There are two node types in the .spec tree:

SECTIONs have:
   * =headline= (default =UNKNOWN=, the root is usually '')
   * =typename= (always =SECTION=)
   * =children= - array of child nodes (sections and keys)
 
Key entries (such as ={DataDir}=) have:
   * =keys= e.g. ={Store}{Cupboard}=
   * =typename= (from the .spec)
   * Other keys from the .spec e.g. =SIZE=, =FEEDBACK=, =CHECK=



---++ Installation
You do not need to install anything in the browser to use this extension. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server.

Open configure, and open the "Extensions" section. Use "Find More Extensions" to get a list of available extensions. Select "Install".

If you have any problems, or if the extension isn't available in =configure=, then you can still install manually from the command-line. See http://foswiki.org/Support/ManuallyInstallingExtensions for more help.

The plugin uses the =JsonRpcContrib=, which must be installed.
